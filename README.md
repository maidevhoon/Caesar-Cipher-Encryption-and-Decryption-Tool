# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Overview
This project implements a **Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool** with a simple and intuitive web interface. The Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a specified number, providing a basic but effective encryption method. This tool allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by specifying a shift value.

## Features
- **Encrypt Messages**: Users can input any text and specify a shift value to encrypt the message.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Users can also input an encrypted message and use the shift value to decrypt it.
- **Responsive Design**: The web interface is designed with **HTML** and **CSS** to be clean, simple, and user-friendly.
- **Clear Results**: Encrypted or decrypted messages are displayed on the same page for immediate results.

## Project Details
- **Languages Used**: 
  - **HTML** for structure
  - **CSS** for styling
  - **Python** for Caesar Cipher encryption logic
- **Key Features**:
  - Easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting text
  - Interactive and visually appealing design
  - Clean layout for better user experience
